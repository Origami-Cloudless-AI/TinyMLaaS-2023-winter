- Arttu has finalized training of the model. Few challenges in docker environment; the model seems to be 'perfect', when it shouldn't and UI needs to be improved.
- Borna and Nella has been able to convert Jupyter notebooks correctly to python files. However, pytest isn't working, since python functions are not correctly imported.
- Leevi is working on sending the image data via network. Faced some issues, but help has been already asked from Hiroshi.  
- Tuula has finalized research on relevant UI/Services. Problems committing changes to main repo.
